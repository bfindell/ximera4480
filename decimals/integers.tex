\maketitle


To explain integer arithmetic, here are some ideas: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Patterns
\item Fact families
\item Algebraic reasoning
\item Models, red and black chips, walking on a number line, checks and bills, etc. 
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Integers as Directed Segments}

Integers $4$ and $-3$ as points: 

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[<->, line width=.75pt] (-5.5,0) -- (5.5,0);
    \foreach \i in {-5,-4,...,5} % numbers on line
      \draw (\i,0.1) -- + (0,-0.2) node[below] {\normalsize $\i$}; % tick and their labels
	\fill[red] (-3,0) circle (0.6 mm);
	\fill[blue] (4,0) circle (0.6 mm);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  
Integers $4$ and $-3$ as vectors: 

    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[<->, line width=.75pt] (-5.5,0) -- (5.5,0);
    \foreach \i in {-5,-4,...,5} % numbers on line
      \draw (\i,0.1) -- + (0,-0.2) node[below] {\normalsize $\i$}; % tick and their labels
	\draw[red, ->, line width=1.25pt] (0,0) -- (-3,0);
	\draw[blue, ->, line width=1.25pt] (0,0) -- (4,0);
   \end{tikzpicture}
   
Integer sum, $4 + -3$ as point + vector:  

    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[<->, line width=.75pt] (-5.5,0) -- (5.5,0);
    \foreach \i in {-5,-4,...,5} % numbers on line
      \draw (\i,0.1) -- + (0,-0.2) node[below] {\normalsize $\i$}; % tick and their labels
	\fill[blue] (4,0) circle (0.6 mm);
	\draw[red, ->, line width=1.25pt] (4,0) -- (1,0);
   \end{tikzpicture}

Integer sum, $4 + -3$ as vector + vector:  

    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[<->, line width=.75pt] (-5.5,0) -- (5.5,0);
    \foreach \i in {-5,-4,...,5} % numbers on line
      \draw (\i,0.1) -- + (0,-0.2) node[below] {\normalsize $\i$}; % tick and their labels
	\draw[blue, ->, line width=1.25pt] (0,0) -- (4,0);
 	\draw[red, ->, line width=1.25pt] (4,0.1) -- (1,0.1);
   \end{tikzpicture}

\dots and we can think of the sum as a point or as a vector.
