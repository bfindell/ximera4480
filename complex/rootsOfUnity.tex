\begin{definition}
Given a positive integer $n$, a solution to the equation $x^n=1$ is called an \textbf{$n^\text{th}$  root of unity}.    

If $x$ is an $n^\text{th}$ root of unity and $x^k\ne 1$ for all integers $k$, $0<k<n$, then $x$ is called a \textbf{primitive $n^\text{th}$ root of unity}.
\end{definition}
 
\begin{problem}
In a previous activity, you found the $4^\text{th}$ roots of unity.  They were the solutions to the equation (in $x$)
\[
\answer{x^4} = 1.  
\]
How many solutions did you find?  $\answer{4}$
\begin{problem}
List the $4^\text{th}$ roots of unity in increasing order of their angles, $\theta$, assuming $0\le \theta<2\pi$: 
\[
\answer{1}, \answer{i}, \answer{-1}\text{, and }\answer{-i}. 
\]
\begin{problem}
For each of the $4^\text{th}$ roots of unity, indicate the smallest positive $k$ for which $x^k = 1$.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x=1$, $k=\answer{1}$.  
\item $x=i$, $k=\answer{4}$.
\item $x=-1$, $k=\answer{2}$.  
\item $x=-i$, $k=\answer{4}$.
\end{enumerate}
So how many of these $4^\text{th}$ roots of unity are \textbf{primitive} $4^\text{th}$ roots of unity?  
$\answer{2}$
\begin{problem}
Correct!  Which ones?  $\answer{i}$ and $\answer{-i}$.  
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
In a previous activity, you found the $6^\text{th}$ roots of unity.  They were the solutions to the equation (in $x$)
\[
\answer{x^6} = 1.  
\]
How many solutions did you find?  $\answer{6}$
\begin{problem}
List the $6^\text{th}$ roots of unity in increasing order of their angles, $\theta$, assuming $0\le \theta<2\pi$: 
\[
\answer{1}, \answer{\frac{1+i\sqrt{3}}{2}}, \answer{\frac{-1+i\sqrt{3}}{2}}, 
\answer{-1}, \answer{\frac{-1-i\sqrt{3}}{2}}\text{, and }\answer{\frac{1-i\sqrt{3}}{2}}. 
\]
\begin{problem}
For each of the $6^\text{th}$ roots of unity, indicate the smallest positive $k$ for which $x^k = 1$.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x=1$, $k=\answer{1}$.  
\item $x=\frac{1+i\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $k=\answer{6}$.
\item $x=\frac{-1+i\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $k=\answer{3}$.
\item $x=-1$, $k=\answer{2}$.  
\item $x=\frac{-1-i\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $k=\answer{3}$.
\item $x=\frac{1-i\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $k=\answer{6}$.
\end{enumerate}
So how many of these $6^\text{th}$ roots of unity are \textbf{primitive} $6^\text{th}$ roots of unity?  
$\answer{2}$
\begin{problem}
Correct!  Which ones?  $\answer{\frac{1+i\sqrt{3}}{2}}$ and $\answer{\frac{1-i\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.  
\begin{problem}
Yes!  

And $x=-1$ is a primitive \wordChoice{\choice{first} \choice[correct]{square} \choice{cube} \choice{fourth} \choice{$n^\text{th}$} } root of unity,  
while $x=\frac{-1+i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $x=\frac{-1-i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ are primitive \wordChoice{\choice{first} \choice{square} \choice[correct]{cube} \choice{fourth} \choice{$n^\text{th}$} } roots of unity.

\begin{problem}
If $z = a + bi$ (with $b$ not $0$) is a primitive $n^\text{th}$ root of unity, then is the conjugate of $z$ also a primitive $n^\text{th}$ root of unity?  Make a conjecture and prove it.

\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
Can you find all the $n^\text{th}$ roots of unity for $n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$, and $10$?  For each $n$, can you determine which of the $n^\text{th}$ roots of unity are \textbf{primitive} $n^\text{th}$ roots of unity?  Be sure that you are able to demonstrate that each root is actually a primitive $n^\text{th}$ root of unity and also that you have found them all.
