Modular arithmetic is usually described informally as ``clock arithmetic'' or as ``arithmetic of remainders.''  The system is constructed formally as equivalence classes of integers,   In both cases, there are no points ``between'' consecutive numbers, such as 0 and 1.  

\subsection*{Background}
\paragraph{Division Theorem} Given integers $a$ and $b$ with $b\neq 0$, there exist unique integers $q$ (the quotient) and $r$ (the remainder) such that $a = bq + r$, with $0 \leq r < b$.
 
\paragraph{Definition of Modular Arithmetic}  Let $n$, $a$, and $b$ be integers, with $n > 0$.  Then $a$ and $b$ are congruent modulo $n$, written $a\equiv b\pmod{n}$, if $n$ divides the difference $a-b$, that is, if there exists an integer $k$ such that $a-b = kn$.
  
Examples:  
$$15\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$$

$$7\equiv  22 \pmod{5}$$

\paragraph{Theorem 1}
For integers $a$ and $b$, $a\equiv b \pmod{n}$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ have the same nonnegative remainder after dividing by $n$.

\paragraph{Theorem 2}
Let $a, b, c, d, k$ and $n$ be integers with $k>1$ and $n > 1$.
\begin{enumerate}%[(a)]
\item $a\equiv a \pmod{n}$
\item If $a\equiv b \pmod{n}$, then $b\equiv a \pmod{n}$.  
\item If $a\equiv b \pmod{n}$ and $b\equiv c \pmod{n}$, then $a\equiv c \pmod{n}$.
\item If $a\equiv b \pmod{n}$ and $c\equiv d \pmod{n}$, then $a+c\equiv b+d \pmod{n}$ and $ac\equiv bd \pmod{n}$
\item If $a\equiv b \pmod{n}$, then $a^k\equiv b^k \pmod{n}$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problems}

\begin{problem}
Most adults know divisibility rules for 2, 5, and 10.  Some adults know divisibility rules for 3, 4, 9, and even 11.  For $n = 2^k, 3, 5^k, 6, 9$, and $11$, where $k$ is a counting number, generalize the divisibility rules so that they are ``remainder rules'' for finding remainders modulo $n$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Prove your remainder rule works for finding remainders modulo $4$.  
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Prove your remainder rule works for finding remainders modulo $9$.  
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Prove Theorem 1 above.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Prove Theorem 2 above. 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Explain how Theorem 2 establishes that ``equivalence mod $n$'' is indeed an equivalence relation. 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Explain how Theorem 2 establishes that the operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation are ``well defined.''
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Which numbers have multiplicative inverses mod $n$?  What does it mean to be a multiplicative inverse?
